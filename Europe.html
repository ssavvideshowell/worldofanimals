                Europe is a continent in the Northern Hemisphere that, along with Asia, makes up the landmass known as “Eurasia”.

Europe is home to a wide range of habitats and a correspondingly wide diversity of animals. Important European animal habitats include taiga forest, tundra, broadleaf forest, steppe, the Alps, Pyrenees, and other mountain ranges; the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, the Mediterranean Sea, and numerous large rivers and lakes.

Examples of European animals include mammals such as the brown bear, Eurasian lynx, grey wolf, red deer and wild boar; reptiles such as the European adder, slow worm and common lizard; amphibians such as the common frog, fire salamander and smooth newt; and birds such as the capercaillie, Eurasian eagle owl and golden eagle.

The common blackbird (whose name is usually shortened to simply “blackbird”) is a member of the thrush family found throughout much of Europe. It is a common sight in the continent’s gardens, parks, and woodlands.

True to its name, the male blackbird is black, with a bright, orange-yellow bill and a thin yellow ring around each eye. The female, however, is grey-brown, with a streaked chest and a dull yellow bill.

The blackbird is known for its melodic song, which can be heard in spring and summer, and its frantic alarm call.

          <strong>Common European Adder</strong>
          <br>

          <br>
          The common European adder is found from the UK and France eastwards across much of Europe and into Asia. It lives in heaths, moors and woodland edges.

          Found further north than any other snake, the common European adder is even present within the Arctic Circle. The species hibernates in the winter, and is most active in spring, when mating occurs.
          
          The common European adder is the only venomous snake found in Britain. Although a bite from an adder can be painful, it is non-lethal to most healthy humans.
          
          The adder is grey / pale brown in color, and easily identified by the zig zag marking running along the length of its back. Some individuals are red-brown or even black in color.
          
          The species can reach lengths of up to 75 cm (30 in.), although most are significantly smaller than this.          <br>
