                Being the 3rd largest continent in the world, it is not surprising that North America is home to many diverse species.  The sheer variety in habitats includes grasslands, forests, swamps, mountains, deserts, tundra, seas, and oceans. North America is simultaneously home to species like the cold-loving polar bear and the rattlesnakes that thrive in the deserts.

Canada, the northernmost part of North America, is primarily cold, with many animals living in snowy conditions. Still, places with slightly higher temperatures, like temperate forests and grasslands, exist. The central part of North America, the United States, has the most variety of biomes, including deserts, swamps, and mountains. Mexico, the southern part of North America, tends to be hot with places like deserts and rainforests

A subspecies of the gray wolf, the arctic wolf is found in regions of colder climates. Also referred to as the polar wolf or the white wolf, it is easily recognizable from its smaller size and snowy-white fur.  However, they are challenging to spot in the wild because they live in harsh conditions, making it hard to observe them regularly.
