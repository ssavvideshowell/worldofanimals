                South America is a continent known for its high biodiversity. Its rainforests, grasslands, mountains and deserts are home to a vast number of species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth.

South American animals include mammals such as anteaters, tapirs, jaguar, maned wolf, howler monkeys and spider monkeys; reptiles such as caimans, anacondas and iguanas; amphibians such as poison dart frogs and the red-eyed tree frog; and birds such as the harpy eagle, rheas and macaws.

<br>
Piranhas are freshwater fish found in rivers and lakes in South America.

Equipped with large teeth and powerful jaws, piranhas have a reputation as being fearsome predators. This is only partially true; most piranhas are omnivores, and are often themselves the prey of other freshwater animals such as caimans.

Piranhas will occasionally attack humans, but this usually results in nothing more than minor cuts to the hands or feet.

          <strong>Capybara</strong>

          The capybara is the worldâ€™s largest rodent, growing to around the size of a Labrador retriever. This freshwater mammal is found throughout much of South America (all countries apart from Chile) and into Central America. Escapee capybaras have also been found in Florida.

The capybara is semiaquatic, and never found far from water. Its toes are slightly webbed for swimming, and it can stay underwater for up to five minutes.
